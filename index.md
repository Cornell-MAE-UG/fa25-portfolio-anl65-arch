## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Adam Levin, and I am a sophomore undergraduate student at Cornell Univeristy, studying biomedical engineering on the pre-med path. I plan on pursuing a career in medicine and currently aspire to be an orthopedic surgeon, although this speciality is subject to change along the lenghty journey ahead of me. On campus I am involved with a few different student-led organizations. I am a member of the Medical Ethics and Dilemmas Society, Sports Medicine Club, TAMID (a business and consulting focused club), and the Pi Sigma Epsilon professional business fraternity. Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I particularly enjoy exercising through either weight lifting or playing sports.
